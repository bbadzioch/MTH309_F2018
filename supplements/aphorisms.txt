ALLAY THE ANGER OF YOUR FRIEND BY KINDNESS 
RECEIVE AN INJURY RATHER THAN DO ONE 
A TRIFLING RUMOR MAY CAUSE A GREAT CALAMITY 
TO DO TWO THINGS AT ONCE IS TO DO NEITHER 
SUSPICION CLEAVES TO THE DARK SIDE OF THINGS 
EVEN WHEN WE GET WHAT WE WISH IT IS NOT OURS

IT IS MADNESS TO PUT CONFIDENCE IN ERROR 
TURN A DEAF EAR TO CALUMNIOUS REPORTS 
YESTERDAY SHOULD BE THE TEACHER OF TODAY 
DISCORD GIVES A RELISH FOR CONCORD
